# npm

Various node.js libraries by Max Edwards M.Eng., individually packaged up for publication in the npm repo.

Mainly so that I can use them wherever I want, but some may end up being useful to others - who knows.

Available via npm as @maxedwards/<package name>

Some of them depend on others, which is the motivation for some of them being here in the first place as some are quite obscure and unlikely to be useful by others.
